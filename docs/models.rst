Test Models
===========

This document describes all test models generated by
``generate_test_models.py``. The models and their artefacts are used
forunit testing the converter and its modules.
Models that contain all weights are pretrained for their respective
tasks and can be used for inference.

Models that have their weights stripped only contain constants used in
operations (e.g. Reshape sizes or constant summands, etc.). These models
cannot be used to run inference and are limited to structural information
only. All models use ``dytpe.float32`` for input and output tensors.
Inputs and outputs are described by their respective tensor shapes.

Atari Net
---------

This model is based on `Deepmind's Q-learning model for playing Atari games`__.

* **Formats:** Frozen Graph ``[json]``
* **Weights:** ``[stripped]``
* **Inputs:** ``(128, 128, 3)`` (*RGB image*)
* **Outputs:** ``(10)`` (*action indicator*)
* **Files:**
    • ``atari_net.json``

Simple
------

Contains a single layer perceptron that estimates ``y = 5·x``.

* **Formats:** Frozen Graph ``[proto]``, TFJS Graph Model
* **Weights:** ``[all]``
* **Inputs:** ``(1)`` (*x*)
* **Outputs:** ``(1,1)`` (*y = 5·x*)
* **Files:**
    • ``simple/frozen_graph.pb``
    • ``simple/model.json``

Prelu
-----

Dual-layer classifier that uses a PReLU activation layer to predict, whether a
point is located inside or outside a sphere given sphere centre and radius.

The sphere coordinates as well as all inputs need to be normalised to the
range [-1, 1]. Inputs are as follows

============ ================  ====
Tensor index Content           Name
============ ================  ====
0            sphere centre x   cx
------------ ----------------  ----
1            sphere centre y   cy
------------ ----------------  ----
2            sphere centre z   cz
------------ ----------------  ----
3            sphere radius     r
------------ ----------------  ----
4            sample point x    px
------------ ----------------  ----
5            sample point y    py
------------ ----------------  ----
6            sample point z    pz
============ ================  ====

The coordinates of every point contained within the sphere must also fall
into the range [-1, 1].

* **Formats:** Keras ```[HDF5]``, TFJS Graph Model
* **Weights:** ``[all]``
* **Inputs:** ``(7)`` (*cx, cy, cz, r, px, py, pz*)
* **Outputs:** ``(1,1)`` (*0 → outside; 1 → inside*)
* **Files:**
